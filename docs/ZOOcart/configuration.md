### Quick note
After that the additional tabs: **“Orders”** and **“ZOOcart Config”** will be displayed right after **“Config”** tab.

## Step 2. Setup the Type

You need to add ZOOcart elements: **“PricePro”** , **“Quantity”** and **“AddToCart”** to the item type, that will be used as a product type (e.g. Product, Article, e.t.c) of the chosen application.
If you are not familiar with this process please review the [official ZOO docs](http://www.yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/extend-pre-build-types)

## Step 3. Assign Price and Quantity for the Type.

ZOOcart requires you to set Quantity and Price obviously for the type.
